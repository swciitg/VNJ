This is the Sigma Designs distribution of the Linux kernel for the MIPS architecture.

The kernel preparation process is Makefile driven. Type 'make' in the main directory
to start preparing the kernel sources and follow the instructions.

Note about the integration with the rootfs package
==================================================
The kernel source package is now integrated with the rootfs package and is able
to interact with it in two distinct ways:

 a) it can grab the rootfs image produced by the rootfs package and use that as
    its initial RAM disk
 b) it can install its modules into the rootfs package so that they make it to
    the rootfs image

For both interactions to be able to take place, the SMP86XX_ROOTFS_PATH 
environment variable must be defined, and must point to the main directory of 
the rootfs package.

The easiest way to achieve that is by sourcing the 'rootfs-path.env' environment
file, which is created very early in the main rootfs package directory. See the
README in the rootfs package for more information about this.

When this environment variable is defined and points to a valid place, two 
things will happen:

 a) when building any of 'all', 'vmlinux', 'vmlinux.bin', 'vmlinux.zbf', the 
    rootfs image found in the main directory of the rootfs package will be
    pulled and used as for the initrd image for the kernel.
 b) then building the 'modules_install' target, the kernel modules and related
    support files (such as modules.dep) will be installed in the correct 
    directory under the customization directory (usually 'package/customize/source')
    of the rootfs package. If customization is enabled in the rootfs package,
    then the modules and support files will be present in the rootfs image.
